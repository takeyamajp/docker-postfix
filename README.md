## How to use
You can send a mail using a secure connection (SSL/TLS).  
In advance you may need to add SPF, DKIM, DMARC records to your DNS server in order that your mail avoids being marked as a spam.

### via [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose)

    version: '3'  
    services:  
      postfix:  
        image: takeyamajp/postfix  
        ports:  
          - "8025:25"  
          - "8587:587"  
          - "8465:465"  
        volumes:  
          - /my/own/certs:/ssl_certs  
          - /my/own/keys:/dkim_keys  
        environment:  
          TIMEZONE: "Asia/Tokyo"  
          HOSTNAME: "smtp.example.com"  
          DOMAIN_NAME: "example.com"  
          MESSAGE_SIZE_LIMIT: "10240000"  
          AUTH_USER: "user"  
          AUTH_PASSWORD: "password"  
          DISABLE_SMTP_AUTH_ON_PORT_25: "true"  
          ENABLE_DKIM: "true"  
          DKIM_KEY_LENGTH: "1024"  
          DKIM_SELECTOR: "default"

## Time zone
You can use any time zone such as America/Chicago that can be used in Rocky Linux.  

See below for zones.  
https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/verify/zones/en.html

## Message size limit
The maximum size in bytes of a mail you can send. (attached files included)  
Increase the value of MESSAGE_SIZE_LIMIT, if you send a mail of more than 10MB size.

## Username
The user name used at authentication will be a format like a e-mail address (e.g. user@example.com).  
It won't be included in a sent mail, so you can use any sender address according to your purpose.

## Port No.
You can usually use submission port 587.  
Use port 465 if your mail client needs SMTPS (SMTP over SSL), then ignore a displayed certificate warning.  
Port 25 is disabled by default. Set DISABLE_SMTP_AUTH_ON_PORT_25 to false If you want to use it.

## SSL certificates
The self-signed certificate will be created automatically into the volume '/ssl_certs', and it can be added to your OS (e.g. Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android) as the root certificate in order to avoid warnings on your mail clients.  

If you have valid server certificates, you can use them.  
And if you also have the intermediate certificate, append after the server certificate.  

    cat server_cert.pem intermediate_CA.pem > cert.pem

## DKIM keys
The public key will be displayed on 'docker logs'.  
Mount the volume '/dkim_keys' on your host machine. Otherwise the key will be changed every time this container starts.  
You can set DKIM_KEY_LENGTH to 2048 if your DNS server supports TXT records of more than 255 length.  
If you have a mail server besides this container, you will need to change DKIM_SELECTOR from 'default' so that it doesn't overlap with other one.

## Logging
This container logs all failed and successful deliveries to 'docker logs'.

Use the following command to view the logs in real time.

    docker logs -f postfix
